# Bellabeat Case Study

 Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Developing beautifully designed technology that
 informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to
 empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly
 positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.

 ASK 1.What are some trends in smart device usage?
      2.How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
      3.How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

Prepare
-Data found in <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit> 
 (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius: <https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic>
 contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data,
 including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.
 It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.
- Data is orginized in a long format
- Data has a CC1.0 licence as a public domain

- For this analysis, I will be focusing on the daily data as my analysis will be on detecting high-level trends in smart device usage.
-  I will be using the “dailyActivity_merged”, and “sleepDay_merged” datasets as they will probably give some interesting insights into the user data.

## ANALYSIS

dailyActivity_merged %>% 
  select(TotalSteps,
         TotalDistance,
         VeryActiveMinutes,
         FairlyActiveMinutes,
         LightlyActiveMinutes,
         SedentaryMinutes,
         Calories) %>% 
  summary()

##Observations:
  
# Average sedentary minutes were at 955.2 minutes or 16 hours.
# Average very active minutes and fairly active minutes were at 23.04 minutes and 14.79 minutes respectively.
# Average lightly active minutes were at 210.3 minutes, or 3.5 hours.
# The average amount of calories burnt per day was around 2362kcal.

##Deductions:
  
# Participants were largely inactive throughout the day.
# Participants spent a low amount of time exercising.
# Participants are unlikely to take part in vigorous activities.

sleep_day_new %>% 
  select(TotalSleepRecords,
         TotalMinutesAsleep,
         TotalTimeInBed) %>% 
  summary()

##Observations:
  
# Participants spent, on average, 458.6 minutes (7.64 hours) in bed.
# Average sleeping time was 419.5 minutes or 7 hours.
# Participants slept once per day on average.

##Deductions:
  
# Participants had an adequate amount of sleep.

The more active that you're, the more steps you take, and the more calories you will burn. This is an obvious fact, but we can still look into the data to find any interesting.
Here we see that some users who are sedentary, take minimal steps, but still able to burn over 1500 to 2500 calories compare to users who are more active, take more steps, but still burn similar calories.
